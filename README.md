# System Programming Lab 11 Multiprocessing

This program uses forks to continually, create child processes until there is enough to match the requested processes, each child computes one frame the dies, resulting in a many frames that can be stitched together using ffmpeg.


# Figure 1 

This figure shows the effects of more processes has on computation time, showing the numper of processes is inversly proportional to the computation time.
